  <p>Jobsplane is a job aggregator which helps people across India find the right jobs and internships for them. We worked with the Jobsplane team on an updated brand identity, a redesign of their website, and on the design for their new mobile app.
  <div class="blogtitle2">Identity</div>

  <p>The website and branding for Jobsplane had to be modernised without losing the unique look users were used to. The challenge was to stick with the same red and grey branding as on the jobsplane.com website, combine it with the material design guidelines to get a cohesive design identity, and apply it across the new website and app. We made the logo sleeker, created a color palette based on the colors used in the logo and website and worked on a caped mascot for the brand.

<div class="blogtitle2">Website</div>

<p>The Jobsplane website did not have a landing page - first time users were directly lead to job listings, and if they tried to apply for a job, they would be asked to sign up or sign in. We created a landing page that explained the core ideas behind Jobsplane, and created an onboarding process for first time users.

<div class="blogtitle2">Mobile App</div>
<p>Jobsplane creates a database of jobs, and uses machine learning algorithms to match users to the best possible jobs for them. To help users apply for the right jobs, the UX for the app needed to be radically different from the website. While the website aimed at showing users all of their options and letting them pick the jobs they were most interested in, this can quickly get overwhelming on mobile.

<div class="imgdesc">We can take advantage of the larger screen area on desktops and laptops to show multiple jobs at a time. On a phone-sized screen, however, this leads to an unpleasant, cluttered interface.</div>
<p>The solution, then, is to show the user only one job at a time. The app curates the jobs most suitable for the user, and these jobs are then shown sequentially to the user. The user can choose to apply for the job, or ignore it. The most convenient way to implement this was with Tinder-style cards which could be swiped left to reject the job, or right to send an application.
<p>The problem with this approach was that not all users would be familiar with the swiping gesture. After some consideration, we decided to use the onboarding process as a small training exercise. Instead of the a full-screen onboarding, we used the same swipeable cards as the jobs screen. The first card instructs you to swipe right to begin, and the user learns that cards can be swiped away.

<p><p>After the onboarding, the user can sign in and start filling out their details. If a user already uses the Jobsplane.com website, their data will be auto-filled from the website database.
