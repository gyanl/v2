<p>It's almost 12 when the movie ends, so it's dark outside when it ends and you get out of the hall. You start thinking about how movies are an escape to a perfect sort of world - where it's always a/c cold, and the people are all nice looking and have fascinating lives and always sort themselves out in 3 hours tops. A world where everything you wish would happen, happens. For a while, you are the actor, living their perfect lives. You are the chosen one, you get the pretty girl you like, anyone who's ever harmed you suffers for it. You are happy. You know it's not real, but as you stare vacantly at the huge screen, it's real. Just for a moment.

<p>And then, just as suddenly, all at once, it's over. The movie ends. Everyone gets up, and once again, you're one in a milling crowd. You are shoved unceremoniously into what is <i>always</i> a dirty staircase which opens into a dingy back alley, and you feel the hot humid air. It hits you then. It's when you really realize - life isn't a movie.
<p>Or maybe it is one, you think. But a shitty one.
