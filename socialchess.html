  <div class="blogtitle2">About Social Chess</div>
  <p>Social chess is a chess app for Android that lets you play chess with your friends. It allows users to play real-time and correspondence games with players around the world.

<div class="blogtitle2">The Problem</div>
<p>Most chess apps use a very particular style of icons which have become the de-facto standard since they've been in use since the early days of computers. While this standardisation brings consistency to the experience, they aren't exactly the <i>best looking</i> icons.
<br></p><center><img src="/assets/img/chess-standard.png"></center><br>

<p>While designing the icons for the app, there were some very distinct goals in mind - the icons had to look good in small  squares, perform well across a range of android screen sizes and resolutions, and be clearly distinct from each other. There was another challenge as well - the black and white icons both had to look good on dark as well as light squares.

  <div class="blogtitle2">The Solution</div>
<p>The final icons were designed as vectors in Illustrator, and went through a series of refinements based on in-game testing. A white outline was added to the black shapes, and vice-versa to make sure the icons stood out on squares of both colors.

      <div class="blogtitle2">App Icon</div>
      <p>The app icon is derived from the iconset designed for the game, and uses two chess pieces placed next to each other.
